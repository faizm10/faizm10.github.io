Design a growing artistic exhibit of your own making, with semantic search
powered by OpenAI CLIP. Bring your own labels and context.

Creativity and curiosity require associative thinking. What if computers could
connect us with masterpieces made by artists of the past? Dispict is a new way
to experience the Harvard Art Museums' online collection (containing over
200,000 digitized works) through language-image machine learning models, helping
you curate your own personalized galleries.
