Harvard has many course search websites, but none of them are good. This project
is an attempt to take the problem more seriously: write high-performance
software and set great defaults so that people can get better, more useful
suggestions, 100x faster.

Classes.wtf is a custom, distributed course search engine that focuses on speed
and quality of results. The goal is for the entire {request, computation,
response, and render} pipeline to take under 30 milliseconds. I built it in a
weekend out of personal annoyance and launched a week later; it's now pretty
popular among students at my school.
