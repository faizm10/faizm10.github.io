This is a Rust implementation of µKanren, a very minimal language in the
miniKanren family. See the original Scheme implementation
[here](http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf) for
reference. Similar to how functional programming focuses on functions as the
core unit of abstraction, relational programming aims to represent common
mathematical concepts as _logical relations_.

The library was originally implemented as an exercise for a graduate programming
languages design seminar at Harvard, but I made the code available to the open
source community as a Rust crate.
