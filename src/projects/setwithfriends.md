_Set with Friends_ is a web implementation of a real-time pattern matching card
game called [Set](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)>). Originally,
when I was at [SPARC 2019](https://sparc-camp.org/), I wondered how I could
bridge the 3000 mile gap between some of the friends I had made after we parted
ways. _Set with Friends_ lets you play Set online with minimal overhead (no
login necessary); it's as simple as sharing a custom link and having fun!

During the design process, I learned about Firebase, so working on this app
introduced me to serverless architectures and provided a good exercise in
creating live interfaces. We completely overhauled the design in May and
released version 2.0 in June. At its peak, the website had over 40,000 monthly
active users for half a year, and as of September 2022 there have been 5,000,000
games played.
