This was one of my first fun programming projects, a visual experiment
simulating gravity in a system with hundreds of interacting objects.
Calculations are done using simple physics formulas, with a bit of damping to
make them more robust. The user can click to add an invisible mass that attracts
all objects to the cursor. Everything is rendered in real time on a `<canvas>`
element, and it's quite satisfying to move the colorful balls around!
