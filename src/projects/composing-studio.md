_Composing Studio_ is a free and easy-to-use online music notation editor that
lets anyone collaborate in real time on short musical pieces. To use it, just go
to [composing.studio](https://composing.studio/) in your browser, create a new
session, and share the link with other musicians! There's no setup or
installation required. You'll be able to typeset musical notation while seeing
each other's work in real time (just like Google Docs), with instant sheet music
rendering and live audio playback.

This project originated at [HackMIT 2021](https://hackmit.org/) (we won a grand
prize), where I pitched the idea and formed a team of four programmer-musicians.
Although we hadn't previously known each other, we all shared the same goal of
exploring collaborative music with the global community.
