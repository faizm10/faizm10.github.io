Rushlight is my take on the _essence_ of a persistent, collaborative text editor
based on operational transformation, as a library you would embed in a larger
app.

It supports multiple real-time documents, with live cursors, based on
CodeMirror 6. The backend is stateless, and you bring your own transport â€” even
a boring HTTP handler works. There aren't any proprietary gadgets or opaque
configurations. It's just a distributed data structure in its purest pragmatic
form.
