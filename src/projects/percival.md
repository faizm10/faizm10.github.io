[Percival](https://percival.ink/) is a **declarative data query and
visualization language**. It provides a reactive, web-based notebook environment
for exploring complex datasets, producing interactive graphics, and sharing
results.

Percival combines the flexibility of
[_Datalog_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog) as a query language for
relational data with the beauty of
[_exploratory visualization grammars_](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot).
These declarative components interact through a reactive dataflow system.
Because Percival uses web technologies (including Web Workers for multithreaded,
sandboxed execution), fully-interactive notebooks can be shared with anyone on
the Internet, making data analyses more tangible to others.
