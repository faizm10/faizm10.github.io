Top competitive programmers have dedicated setups on their local machines that
let them quickly creating new programs from templates, generate input files, and
run code on suites of test data. But what if you're working on a different
computer, and you don't have all of these tools installed?

_Workspace_ is a side-by-side problem viewer and code editor that allows you to
run code online. It supports advanced features like autocompletion and
automatically parses of test cases for each problem, saving time in a
programming competition. This was inspired by
[CS Academy](https://csacademy.com/)'s interface.

The web server lets you scrape problems from online judges at the click of a
button. All code is automatically saved and synchronized with a MongoDB instance
in the cloud, so it persists across sessions and browsers. See the website below
to try it out.
