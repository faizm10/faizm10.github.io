I maintain an open-source library of about thirty-five C++ templates for
algorithms and data structures. These are fairly advanced tricks targeted toward
top competitive programmers, including fast implementations of FFT, Aho-Corasick
string search, and Dinic's blocking flow algorithm, as well as data structures
like link-cut trees and centroid decomposition.

This is accessible on a static website, which I developed using Angular. The
website also includes a searchable collection of more than 600 code samples from
other open-source libraries.
