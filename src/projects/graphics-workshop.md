This workshop contains a selection of self-guided projects designed to teach the
basics of computer graphics. Each project introduces an important graphics
technique that is extensively used in real-world applications. The code is
designed to run in real time on modern GPUs, without requiring any extra
software. I wrote this when frustrated with the lack of proper documentation and
simple code examples for GPU shaders.

The topics include fragment shaders
([GLSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language)), procedural
texture generation, rasterization, lighting calculations, and real-time ray
tracing. I hosted a live version of this workshop at Harvard, and it has been
used by thousands of self-learners after gaining popularity in the
[/r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/) community.
